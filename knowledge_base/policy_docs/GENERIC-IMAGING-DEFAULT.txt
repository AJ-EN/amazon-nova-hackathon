Title: Generic Imaging Prior Authorization Criteria

Covered Procedure Codes: (all imaging procedure codes not covered by payer-specific policies)

Service Keywords: (none — applies when no payer-specific match is found)

Medical Necessity Criteria (minimum 1 of 2 must be met):
1. clinical_indication: Clinical indication for the requested service is documented.
2. conservative_therapy_6w: Conservative therapy history is provided when appropriate.

Required Documents:
- progress_notes

Common Denial Patterns:
- Demographic mismatch
- Missing clinical rationale

This is the default fallback policy used when no payer-specific prior authorization policy matches the request. It applies generic imaging authorization criteria. Providers should document the clinical indication for the requested service and, where applicable, include a history of conservative therapy attempts.
